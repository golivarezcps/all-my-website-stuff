        <h2 style = "color: rgb(145, 17, 49);">Places I went</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Over winter break I went to California to visit family. But my birthday coincidentally falls during winter break. We went to a few places in Cali, the first one was Hollywood. We visited the walk of fame and looked all the celebrities stars, then the same day we went to Los Angeles and just drove around and saw the sights. The next day was my birthday so we went to <strong>Universal studios</strong>, during our time there we used the <a href="https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/web/en/us/park-map?mapFilters=ush.venues;ush.lower_lot,ush.venues;ush.upper_lot,ush.place_types;ride">interactive map</a> a bunch during our time there. I got go on all the rides, my favorite had to be either the Mummy or the Jurassic Park ride, both are rollercoasters. Finally, we visited Sequoia park to see the massive trees, it was a long trip.</p>
        <h2 style = "color: rgb(145, 17, 49);">Foods I ate</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I ate a variety of foods while in California. As far as fast food goes, I really enjoyed In-n-Out. Another place unique to California that was really good was Dutch Bros. But most of what I ate was stuff my Tia, or aunt, made. Shes a really good cook and made these amazing queso-birrias the first day we stayed there and they were really good. She also made empanadas, cajeta and nutella. They were the best ones I had ever tasted. On Christmas, she made mole, which is like chicken cover in a spicy sauce, tamales, and pozole which is my <i>favorite</i> food. Then on my birthday she made chocoflan and it was very good.</p>
